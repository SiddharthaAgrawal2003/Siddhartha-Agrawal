##  Problem Descriptions

### Problem-1: Calculator Using Class
This program demonstrates object-oriented programming by implementing a calculator using a class.

**Features:**
- Uses encapsulation and class-based design
- Supports the following operations:
  - Addition
  - Subtraction
  - Multiplication
  - Division
- Accepts two double values and an operation type as input
- Handles invalid operations and division by zero gracefully

**Concepts Used:**
- Classes and objects
- Conditional statements
- Exception handling
- Scanner-based input

### 📘 Problem-2: Odd Number Series Using Recursion
This program generates the first `a` odd numbers using a recursive approach without using any loop.

**Features:**
- Takes a single integer as input
- Generates odd numbers using the formula `2n − 1`
- Uses recursion instead of loops
- Prints the series in a comma-separated format

**Concepts Used:**
- Recursion
- Mathematical formulation
- Base and recursive conditions
- Scanner-based input

### 📘 Problem-3: Conditional Odd Number Series
This program generates odd numbers based on whether the input value is even or odd.

**Features:**
- If the input is even, odd numbers are generated up to `a − 1`
- If the input is odd, odd numbers are generated up to `a`
- Uses recursion to generate the series
- Ensures correct output formatting

**Concepts Used:**
- Conditional logic
- Recursion
- Mathematical reasoning
- Input validation

### 📘 Problem-4: Count of Multiples (1 to 9)
This program counts how many numbers in the input list are multiples of values from 1 to 9.

**Features:**
- Accepts a list of integers from the user
- Counts divisibility for numbers 1 through 9
- Displays results in a dictionary-like format
- Maintains ordered output

**Concepts Used:**
- Lists and Maps
- Modulus operator
- Nested iteration
- Scanner-based input handling
